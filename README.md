We can be saved on the grounds of repentance and God's merciful provision, the blood of sacrifice from Christ.
Jesus christ bled, died and rose again
Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness(Matt: 6:33)
We can be sinlessly perfect by His grace when we call upon God.(Matt: 5:48)
Let us read the Bible daily which is our logo and rhema
Pray always in the name of Jesus Christ
